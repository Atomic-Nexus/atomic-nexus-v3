              AI is everywhere. It's in the headlines, in boardroom discussions, and in marketing pitches promising to
              revolutionize your business overnight. But how much of what you hear is reality—and how much is just hype?
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              If you're a business owner trying to navigate the AI landscape, you've likely encountered exaggerated
              claims, conflicting information, and a fair amount of skepticism. Let's break down why AI hype exists,
              debunk common myths, and focus on what AI can actually do for your business today.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-white">Why AI Hype Exists</h2>

            <p className="mb-6">The hype around AI isn't accidental—it's fueled by several key factors:</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-white">Media Sensationalism</h3>

            <p className="mb-6">
              Headlines that scream "AI will replace millions of jobs!" or "This startup built an AI that thinks like a
              human!" grab attention, but they rarely reflect reality. Sensational stories drive clicks, but they often
              oversimplify or exaggerate AI's capabilities.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-white">Marketing Buzz</h3>

            <p className="mb-6">
              Tech companies, startups, and investors have a vested interest in making AI sound more advanced than it
              really is. Terms like "autonomous," "human-like," and "self-learning" get thrown around, even when the AI
              in question is just a well-trained chatbot or automation tool.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-white">Misunderstanding of AI's Capabilities</h3>

            <p className="mb-6">
              People often assume AI is more intelligent than it is. While AI can process massive amounts of data and
              recognize patterns at an impressive scale, it's not truly "thinking" or making independent decisions the
              way humans do.
